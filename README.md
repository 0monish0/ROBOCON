# TKP_1.ino - Controls four LEDs sequentially using a potentiometer, with the number of lit LEDs depending on the potentiometer's value.

# TKP_2.ino - Adjusts the RPM (rotations per minute) of a DC gear motor using a potentiometer, mapping the analog input to a range suitable for motor speed control.

# TKP_3.ino - Measures and prints the distance in centimeters using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor.

# TKP_4.ino - Initializes and displays text on an I2C-interfaced LCD screen.

# TKP_5.ino - Controls the speed of two DC motors using an L293D motor driver shield by reading a value from the serial monitor.

# TKP_6.ino - Implements AND, OR, and XOR logic gates using two slide switches as inputs and a serial monitor to select the gate type.

# TKP_7.ino - Controls two servo motors to move in complementary directions (e.g., one moves from 0 to 90 degrees while the other moves from 180 to 90 degrees) based on a target angle received from the serial monitor.

# TKP_8.ino - Uses two ultrasonic sensors and a slide switch to control a servo motor. One sensor determines the starting position (0° or 180°), the switch triggers movement to the opposite position, and the second sensor controls the speed of that movement.

# TKP_9.ino - Moves a servo to a position mapped from an analog input (like a potentiometer) only when the input value has stabilized within a certain range.

# TKP_10.ino - Controls a three-wheeled robot, enabling it to move forward, backward, left, or right based on commands received from the serial monitor.

# TKP_11.ino - Controls the brightness of an LED using a potentiometer by mapping the analog input to a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) output value.

# TKP_12.ino - Illuminates a sequence of three LEDs based on the distance measured by an ultrasonic sensor, with more LEDs lighting up as the object gets closer.

# TKP_13.ino - Controls the angle of a servo motor using a potentiometer, mapping the analog input to a range of 0 to 180 degrees.
